Gerraint gave us a primer on Linear programming and how the basics work before presenting his work. He then went on to identify how and where the technique can be used.

## Open-source, developer-friendly observability in only a few lines code

Brett took us through how to build simple observability into your systems without having to use masses of code.

He used an example of Rabbits and Pandas through his [Animal Buttons](https://www.animalbuttons.biz/) demo.

Modern stacks might use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) but it takes quite a lot to get it set up. He is helping to work on  [Autometrics](https://autometrics.dev/) which is a 'plugin' replacement for it, but it much simpler.

## How I used PostgreSQL® to find pictures of me at a party

A simple run through of how Tibs used [pgVector])(https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) plus some Python image libraries to be able to find pictures (simple facial 'recognition') of him taken during various work events.
